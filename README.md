# What is Altanic?
Mindustry mod that adds alternative methods to make already existing item. Modification also change vanilla content requirements like you need first make iron and to unlock plastanium compressor. 
# Modification isn't ready yet
I new in programing, in github, in mindustry mod developing. Modifation has trash sprite and long takes to make anything. The version OH NO mean that it is aplha or something like that, there a lot of errors, not finished sprites and pther content.
# Mod is still in polish
Everytihng starts on ZPGM clan server when I upload a mod that adds bigger walls. Modification is still in polsih and I won't change until I finish v1.6 content, and also my english is bad.
